### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project explores data from bike-sharing systems in three major U.S. cities — Chicago, New York City, and Washington — using Python. The program allows users to filter the data by city, month, and day of the week, and calculates statistics such as:

- Most frequent times of travel
- Most popular stations and trips
- Trip duration statistics
- User demographics

The project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program and demonstrates skills in data analysis and working with real-world datasets using Python.

### Files Used
- `bikeshare.py` – Main Python script to interact with the user and analyze bikeshare data.
- `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv` – Datasets provided for analysis (not included in this repository).
- `.gitignore` – Updated to exclude temporary files and system-specific configurations.

### Credits
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) for providing the project template and datasets.
- Python documentation and Stack Overflow for coding assistance and best practices.
