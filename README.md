### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project analyzes bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities — Chicago, New York City, and Washington — using Python. It provides an interactive experience where users can filter the data by city, month, and day of the week to generate meaningful statistics, including:

Peak travel times

Most commonly used stations and trip combinations

Trip duration metrics

User demographic information

Developed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program, this project showcases practical skills in data wrangling, analysis, and interpretation using real-world datasets.
### Files Used
- `bikeshare.py` – Main Python script to interact with the user and analyze bikeshare data.
- `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv` – Datasets provided for analysis (not included in this repository).
- `.gitignore` – Updated to exclude temporary files and system-specific configurations.

### Credits
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) for providing the project template and datasets.
- Python documentation and Stack Overflow for coding assistance and best practices.
